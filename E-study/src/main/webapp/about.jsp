<p>A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.
</p>
 
<p>E-learning has proved to be the best means in the corporate sector, especially when training programs are conducted by MNCs for professionals across the globe and employees are able to acquire important skills while sitting in a board room, or by having seminars, which are conducted for employees of the same or the different organizations under one roof. The schools which use E-learning technologies are a step ahead of those which still have the traditional approach towards learning.</p>

<p> Indira Gandhi National Open University, known as IGNOU, is a public research university located at Maidan Garhi, New Delhi, India. Named after the former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, the university was established in 1985 with a budget of â‚¹20 million, after the Parliament of India passed the Indira Gandhi National Open University Act, 1985 (IGNOU Act 1985).[4] IGNOU is run by the central government of India, and with a total active enrollment of over 4 million students, it is the largest university in the world.[5][6]
